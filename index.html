  <h1>The GSXR-1000</h1>
  <h2>A Bike That Screams</h2>

  <p>
    The GSXR-1000 is made by Suzuki and it packs a lot of punch. The engine is categorized at 1000 cc’s and its top speed is 186 mph.
    It comes in two color variants, which are blue and white. These choices were purposefully chosen because those are the two colors that represent Suzuki.
    The GSXR-1000 has been around since 2001.
  </p>

  <p>A little more in depth about the GSXR specs:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>It has 200 horsepower.</li>
    <li>The technical cc amount for the GSXR is 999, but because of the overall build it is classified as a 1000cc bike.</li>
    <li>The weight of the bike is roughly 450 pounds, which is very reasonable for a bike in its class.</li>
    <li>The engine is a 4-cylinder engine.
    <li>The Gsxr-1000 has a mx rpm of 14,500</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Why It’s So Cool to Me</h2>

  <p>
    The big reason the GSXR-1000 is so cool to me is not the fact that it is a very fast bike but rather the look of the bike and the dash.
    Most bikes today have full LCD screens for the dash and speedometer, whereas the GSXR has stayed with an analog-style speedometer.
    To me, it feels like I’m riding a bike that was made in the eighties. Another big reason it’s amazing is the sound of the bike when it’s running — so smooth,
    especially if you redline it and get that flutter in sound. It sounds like <em>WANNNNAAAANNNNAAAAANAA!</em>
